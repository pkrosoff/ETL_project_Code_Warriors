# ETL_project_Code_Warriors
<h2>Code Warriors Team - ETL Project - University of Oregon/Trilogy Data Bootcamp</h2>
<br>
<h3>SCOPE</h3>
<br>
Team Code Warriors is planning on joining the following two datasets:
   <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/tcrammond/food-access-and-food-deserts">Census Food Deserts</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/explore-health-rankings/rankings-data-documentation">County Health Rankings</a></li>
   </ul>
  <br>
<h3>CONNECTING</h3>
<br>
<p>We intend to connect the data on a county level by creating compound keys out of State and County name, and then joining the tables on that paramter.</p>
<br>
<h3>DATABASE TYPE</h3>
<ul>
    <li> PostGres </li>
    </ul>
